4 classes.

1)Sensor Manager: manages the sensors.

2)Sensor: different types of sensor availavle, we can use those.


3)SensorEvent: The system uses this class to create a sensor event object, which provides information about a sensor event.
A sensor event object includes the following information: the raw sensor data, the type of sensor that generated the event,
the accuracy of the data, and the timestamp for the event.


4)SensorEventListener: listens the events of sensor.
returns 2 parameters, one parameter is event.


First Step is to create a sensor manager
SensorManager mSensorManager;
mSensorManager = (SensorManager) getSystemService(Context.SENSOR_SERVICE);

Second step is to create sensor(which we want to user)
Sensor mSensor;
mSensor = mSensorManager.getDefaultSensor(Sensor.TYPE_PROXIMITY);

Third step is to register the sensor (for listening the sensor)
mSensorManager.registerListener(this,mSensor,SensorManager.SENSOR_DELAY_NORMAL);

Fourht step is to implement, we have two methods onAccuracyChanged() and onSensorChanged()
onSensorChanged(): this mehtod provides the real time data from sensor when it changes timestamp.
