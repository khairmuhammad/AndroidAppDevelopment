Content Provider
• A content provider manages access to a central repository of data..
• The provider is part of an Android application, which often provides its own UI for working with the data.
• However, content providers are primarily intended to be used by other applications, which access the provider using a provider client object.
• Together, providers and provider clients offer a consistent, standard interface to data that also handles
inter-process communication and secure data access.


Accessing a Content Provider
• A content provider offers methods which
correspond to the basic CRUD functions of
persistent storage.
• An application accesses the data from a content
provider with a ContentResolver client object. This
object has methods that call identicallynamed
methods in the provider object.
• A content provider is identified by a content URI.
